# Focus Tool V2 Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

The Focus Tool has been completely redesigned to improve both functionality and code quality. The tool allows teachers to capture any area of the screen and display it with a whiteboard area for annotations and explanations.

### Key Requirements

1. Display the captured screen area with a 20% enlargement in the top-left of a popup
2. Provide a whiteboard area for additional explanations (taking 3/4 of the popup width)
3. Support drawing tools on both the captured area and whiteboard
4. Enable moving/dragging the popup window
5. Support for dark and light mode themes

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The tool has been restructured with a component-based architecture:

```
FocusToolV2/
├── FocusArea.js         # Main container component
├── FocusImage.js        # Screenshot display component
├── hooks.js             # Custom React hooks
├── index.js             # Entry point/export
├── styles.css           # Unified styles
├── ToolHeader.js        # Tools and controls header
├── ToolOptions.js       # Tool options panel
├── utils.js             # Utility functions
├── Whiteboard.js        # Whiteboard component
└── docs/                # Documentation
```

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Modular Components**: Each part of the UI is now a separate component
2. **Custom Hooks**: For improved state management
   - `useDragging`: Manages popup dragging functionality
   - `useDrawing`: Manages drawing state
   - `useKeyboardShortcuts`: Handles keyboard interactions
3. **Responsive Layout**: The layout maintains the 1/4 to 3/4 ratio between focus area and whiteboard
4. **Performance Optimizations**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders
5. **Better Tool Management**: Tools are applied consistently across both canvas areas

### Technical Highlights

1. **Canvas Drawing**: Using Konva.js for all drawing operations
2. **Zoom Implementation**: Supports zooming the focus area while maintaining proportions
3. **Screenshot Capturing**: Improved method for capturing screen regions
4. **Export Capability**: Can save the combined view as a PNG image

## Improvements Over Previous Version

1. **Code Organization**: Modular structure improves maintainability
2. **State Management**: Better state organization with custom hooks
3. **Layout**: More consistent layout with proper proportions
4. **Performance**: Optimized rendering and event handling
5. **Theme Support**: Improved dark/light mode integration

## Usage Instructions

See the `README.md` and `integration-example.js` for detailed usage instructions and integration examples.

## Future Enhancements

Some potential enhancements for future versions:

1. **Touch Support**: Improve support for touch devices
2. **Additional Tools**: Add more drawing tools (e.g., gradient fills, arrows)
3. **Undo/Redo**: Add history management for drawings
4. **Layers**: Support for multiple drawing layers
5. **Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common teaching scenarios

## Migration

A migration guide (`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`) has been provided to help transition from the original implementation to this new version.
